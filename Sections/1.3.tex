\section{Research Questions}
This study is guided by the following central research questions:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Primary Research Question: 
Can shredded textile waste, when combined with resin, be effectively transformed into structurally viable and sustainable composite bricks suitable for the construction industry globally? 

\item Secondary Research Questions: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the optimal material compositions (fiber types, ratios, and resin types) to achieve favorable physical and mechanical properties in the bricks?

    \item How do resin-bound textile composite bricks compare to traditional clay bricks in terms of compressive strength, durability, bending and water absorption?

    \item What environmental benefits-such as carbon footprint reduction and waste diversion-are associated with using these composite bricks?

    \item What are the potential challenges in manufacturing, standardization, and market acceptance of these bricks within the Bangladeshi context?
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
