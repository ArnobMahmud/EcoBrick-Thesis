# EcoBrick Thesis



Eco bricks are building materials made from sustainable, recycled resources such as plastic, textiles, and other waste materials. They serve as an alternative to traditional clay bricks, which have a significant environmental impact due to the high energy consumption in their production process.


## Structure
- `main.tex`: Main LaTeX file for compiling the thesis.
- `Abstract.tex`, `Acknowledgement.tex`, `Cover.tex`: Front matter sections.
- `Chapters/`: Contains chapter-wise LaTeX files.
- `Sections/`: Contains section-wise LaTeX files for detailed content.
- `Assets/`: Images and figures used in the thesis.

## How to Compile
1. Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX).
2. Compile `main.tex` using your preferred LaTeX editor or command line:
   ```
   pdflatex main.tex
   ```
   Repeat as needed to resolve references.

## Highlights
- Utilizes recycled textile waste for sustainable brick production.
- Experimental results show bricks with 18% waste fabric by weight and polymer-based binders achieve compressive strengths of 3--7 MPa (435--1015 psi).
- Eco-bricks are lightweight, thermally efficient, and cost-effective.
