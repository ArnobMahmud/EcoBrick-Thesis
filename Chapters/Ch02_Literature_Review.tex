\chapter{Literature Review }
A composite is a material manufactured from two or more discrete materials that are insoluble at a macroscopic level but together create enhanced properties. Textile means fibrous goods (like cotton, polyester, denim, woven, or knitted fabric) used as reinforcement in the composite. The matrix is the continuous phase that binds the shredded textiles together and surrounds them, creating a solid form after curing. Sustainable construction material development has been gaining worldwide traction in the aftermath of increasing environmental awareness and infrastructure demands in urban areas. In this scenario, several studies have explored new applications of industrial and agricultural wastes for improving material efficiency, eliminating pollution, and lowering construction costs. This chapter discusses an elaborate review of the existing literature on (i) textile waste generation and disposal, (ii) composite materials through recycled textiles, (iii) resin-based composite applications, and (iv) alternative bricks with waste materials. The purpose is to create a scholarly background and establish research gaps to fill in the context of Bangladesh as well as globally.
