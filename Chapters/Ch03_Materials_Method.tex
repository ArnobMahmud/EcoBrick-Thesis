\chapter{Materials and Methodologies }
In this chapter, the experimental setup followed for the production and testing of textile resin composite bricks is presented. It explains raw material selection and preparation composite formulation design, mixing and molding procedures, and test procedures followed to determine the physical and mechanical behavior of the bricks produced. The method is designed to provide replicability, reliability, and adherence to both engineering standards and sustainable materials development requirements.
